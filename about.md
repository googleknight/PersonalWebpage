* [**An Efficient Spatial Domain based Image Watermarking using Shell Based Pixel Selection**](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7732468/) 
Implemented a new algorithm in spatial domain with shell based pixel selection for watermark embedding and extraction. 
The proposed method is evaluated with benchmark dataset and we obtained a favorable result in terms of PSNR
and BER. We reported the results of various kinds of image manipulation to
assess the performance of the proposed method by drawing a comparative
study of the original watermark and the watermark extracted from a
manipulated image.
